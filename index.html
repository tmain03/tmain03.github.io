            Hi there! 
            <br> 
            <br>
            I am a 4th year UC Berkeley student majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, though I'm originally from San Diego. 
            I have experience with Python, Java, C and C++, SQL, as well as Unity, Godot and C#. I am currently learning about efficient algorithms and cybersecurity. 
            <br><br>
            I am interested in software development and I have a special affinity for video games. 
            I am also interested in web development and am currently learning about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (as you can see).
            <br><br>
            My favorite video game series at the moment is The Legend of Zelda, and I'm playing through Echoes of Wisdom at the moment!
            I like to read in my free time, I'm currently reading Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card, and I collect comic books (Ultimate Spider-Man 2024 is my favorite series).
            <br><br>
            Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would just like to get in touch!
            
        </p>
